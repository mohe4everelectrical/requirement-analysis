## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** are visual representations of the interactions between **actors** (users or external systems) and the system itself. They help to illustrate the functional requirements of a system, showing what the system does and who interacts with it.  

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**
- Provides a clear overview of system functionality.
- Helps stakeholders and developers understand system interactions.
- Facilitates requirement analysis and validation.
- Serves as a communication tool between technical and non-technical team members.
